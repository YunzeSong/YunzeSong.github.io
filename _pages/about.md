Greetings! I am Yunze Song, currently pursuing my graduate studies at the National University of Singapore. My research is centered on advancing the field of artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on the fair evaluation of large models and the safer development of generative AI systems. Additionally, I am exploring the integration of large language models into robotics, aiming to enhance the capabilities of AI-driven systems in practical applications.

I have had the opportunity to conduct research at esteemed institutions such as Peking University and Westlake University, where my work focused on evaluating large language models. I aspire to achieve meaningful outcomes through research and develop the capacity to bring happiness and positive impact to others.

**RAGLAB: A Modular and Research-Oriented Unified Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level capabilities in dialogue, reasoning, and knowledge retention. However, even the most advanced LLMs face challenges such as hallucinations and real-time updating of their knowledge. Current research addresses this bottleneck by equipping LLMs with external knowledge, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, two key issues constrained the development of RAG. First, there is a growing lack of comprehensive and fair comparisons between novel RAG algorithms. Second, open-source tools such as LlamaIndex and LangChain employ high-level abstractions, which results in a lack of transparency and limits the ability to develop novel algorithms and evaluation metrics. To close this gap, we introduce RAGLAB, a modular and research-oriented open-source library. RAGLAB reproduces 6 existing algorithms and provides a comprehensive ecosystem for investigating RAG algorithms. Leveraging RAGLAB, we conduct a fair comparison of 6 RAG algorithms across 10 benchmarks. With RAGLAB, researchers can efficiently compare the performance of various algorithms and develop novel algorithms.
