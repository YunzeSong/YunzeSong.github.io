Greetings! I am Yunze Song, currently pursuing my graduate studies at the National University of Singapore. My research is centered on advancing the field of artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on the fair evaluation of large models and the safer development of generative AI systems. Additionally, I am exploring the integration of large language models into robotics, aiming to enhance the capabilities of AI-driven systems in practical applications.

I have had the opportunity to conduct research at esteemed institutions such as Peking University and Westlake University, where my work focused on LLM Evaluation and Retrieval-Augmented Generation. I aspire to achieve meaningful outcomes through research and develop the capacity to bring happiness and positive impact to others.

**RAGLAB: A Modular and Research-Oriented Unified Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11381) [Code](https://github.com/fate-ubw/RAGLAB) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/fate-ubw/RAGLAB?style=social&label=Stars)**

To address hallucinations and difficulties in updating real-time knowledge, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) equips Large Language Models with external knowledge. However, two major obstacles hinder RAG's progress. First, there is a growing lack of thorough and fair comparisons between emerging RAG algorithms. Second, open-source tools like LlamaIndex and LangChain use high-level abstractions, reducing transparency and limiting innovation in algorithm development and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGLAB, a modular, research-focused open-source library. RAGLAB replicates six existing algorithms and offers a comprehensive ecosystem for exploring RAG techniques. Using RAGLAB, we fairly compare six RAG algorithms across ten benchmarks, enabling researchers to efficiently evaluate and develop new algorithms.
